//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11,
// but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same,
 //but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let Name:string[]=["sara","soha","rija","mahnoor"];
let message ='lets go for shopping :';
for (let i=0; i<Name.length;i++){
console.log(message+Name[i]);}
